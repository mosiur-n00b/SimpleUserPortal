# SimpleUserPortal

In this simple project, I've developed a simple user portal, where only registered users can login using
email and password. I've used phpMyAdmin localhost to manage a MySQL database running on my local XAMPP server.

Tools & Technology:

1. Database: MySQL
2. Front-End: HTML, CSS, jQuery
3. Back-End: PHP

Features:

1. Login Page : User can clear this section. Also for a new user, he has to go Registration Page from here to login.
2. Registration Page : Email address should be unique across the system. Also saves encrypted password to database.
3. Profile Page : User can logout from here. Also user can change their password form this page.
4. Admin Panel : Admin panel shows a list of all registered users. 
5. Search Panel: Admin panel has a textfield to search user.
